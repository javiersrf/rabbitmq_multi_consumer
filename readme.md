# Go RabbitMQ Multi-Consumer Example

This repository contains a simplified example demonstrating how to implement a multi-consumer setup using RabbitMQ in Go. The primary focus is to illustrate the basic principles of consuming messages from a RabbitMQ queue using multiple consumers for increased parallel processing and efficiency.

### Features

- **Simplified Consumer Implementation**: Showcases how to set up a basic consumer that connects to a RabbitMQ queue, waits for messages, and processes them as they arrive.
- **Multi-Consumer Architecture**: Demonstrates how to scale the message processing across multiple consumers, allowing for distributed processing of messages for better throughput and redundancy.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Includes handling for graceful shutdown of consumers, ensuring that all in-flight processing completes before the application exits.
- **Error Handling**: Basic examples of error handling and acknowledgments to ensure message integrity and avoid message loss.

### Getting Started

To get started with this example, ensure you have Go installed on your system and access to a RabbitMQ server. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Update the `config.go` file with your RabbitMQ connection details.
3. Run `make build` to compile the application.
4. Start multiple instances of the application to simulate multiple consumers.

### Usage

This example is intended for educational purposes, to help new developers understand how to implement a basic multi-consumer setup using RabbitMQ in Go. It is not intended for production use without further modifications, including robust error handling, logging, and configuration management.
